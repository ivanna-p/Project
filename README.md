# Project
This was a final project for IT Bootcamp, theme was webshop. 
It's not finished because I've found my first client right after I finished school IT Bootcamp and now I'm focused on that project. 
Plan is to make this webshop responsive, clean up the code and to make another page for "owner" of the shop and
to implement CRUD in it, so product update can be managed directly from the WEB site, not from the SQL database.
